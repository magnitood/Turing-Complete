# Turing Complete Saves

This repository contains my save files for the game Turing Complete

I am uploading it to github because this game is about building a working computer
from basic logic gates.

Since I am using Wine to run my game under linux, the location of this repo in the filesystem is:
$WINE_PREFIX/drive_c/users/mag/AppData/Roaming/Godot/app_userdata/Turing Complete

For windows, the path should be the same
